# Udacity Flower Classifier
This was my submission for the Udacity "AI Programming with Python Nanodegree". The project involved building a deep neural network to classify pictures of flowers.

The project involved importing a densenet161/vgg16 architecture, then stripping away the classifier module and implementing a naive classifier to be trained on recognising 102 categories of flowers. The code was written to run from the command line by passing arguments specifying architecture, training epochs & other hyperparameters.

A Jupyter Notebook is provided which served as the development structure for the final project.
